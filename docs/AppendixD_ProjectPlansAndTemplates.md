# Appendix D: Project Plans and Code Templates

Below is a collection of project plans and code templates referenced throughout this textbook. Rather than embedding all content here, each item is split into its own file for easier navigation and reuse.

---

## D.1 Project Plan – Initial Draft
A basic outline covering data ingestion, cleaning, representative record selection, and categorization. It serves as the starting point for iterative improvements.

- **See file:** [ProjectPlan_InitialDraft.md](templates/ProjectPlan_InitialDraft.md)

---

## D.2 Project Plan – Improved Version
In this iteration, the project plan is enhanced with more detailed steps for filtering, validation, and output generation. It refines the initial draft for better clarity and completeness.

- **See file:** [ProjectPlan_Improved.md](templates/ProjectPlan_Improved.md)

---

## D.3 Project Plan – Advanced Version
This comprehensive plan integrates additional datasets (e.g., demographics), applies race-specific BMI categorizations, and details output summary reporting. It represents a mature workflow for processing clinical EHR data.

- **See file:** [ProjectPlan_Advanced.md](templates/ProjectPlan_Advanced.md)
