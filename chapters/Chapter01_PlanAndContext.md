# Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation ‚Äî Plan & Context

The journey of effectively integrating GenAI tools into your research and coding workflows begins with a crucial first step: meticulous planning and a thorough understanding of the context surrounding your task. Before engaging an LLM, it is essential to lay a solid foundation by clearly defining what you want to achieve and the environment in which you will be working.

The initial stage involves **defining the goal and scope** of your endeavor. This means articulating precisely what you aim to accomplish with the assistance of an LLM. For instance, in the context of our running example, the overarching goal is harmonizing BMI data from EHRs. This broad objective can be broken down into more specific aims, such as cleaning the raw data, creating a summary of BMI categories, or automating a particular data transformation process. A well-defined goal provides a clear direction for subsequent steps, including how you will prompt the LLM and how you will evaluate its output.

Next, it is vital to have a comprehensive **understanding of the context**. This includes noting the specific characteristics of your data, such as its format (e.g., tab-delimited, CSV), the variables it contains (e.g., `person_id`, `encounter_id`, `bmi`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, `measurement_date`), and any domain-specific considerations that might be relevant. In our BMI harmonization example, understanding that the data comes from EHRs implies the need to consider medical standards for BMI categories and potential data quality issues inherent in clinical data. This contextual awareness is critical for tailoring your prompts to the LLM and ensuring that its responses are aligned with the specific requirements of your research domain.

Once the goal and context are clear, the next logical step is to **plan the sub-tasks**. Complex problems are often more manageable when broken down into smaller, actionable steps. For our BMI harmonization project, this might involve sub-tasks such as reading the EHR file, cleaning and filtering the data to remove errors or inconsistencies, selecting a single representative BMI measurement for each person, categorizing the BMI values into meaningful groups (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese), and finally, outputting the processed data and any summary statistics. Planning these sub-tasks provides a structured roadmap for both you and the LLM, making the overall project seem less daunting and easier to execute.

Finally, before you even begin to prompt an LLM, it is essential to **set success criteria**. This involves determining what the final deliverables should be and how you will validate whether your solution is successful. In our BMI example, success might be defined by the creation of a clean dataset containing one representative BMI per person, a summary table showing the distribution of individuals across different BMI categories, and a data dictionary that clearly explains the contents of the cleaned dataset. Establishing these criteria upfront allows for an objective evaluation of the LLM's contribution and the overall outcome of your workflow.

Even at this initial planning stage, LLMs themselves can be valuable tools. You can **leverage LLMs in the planning phase** by prompting them to help brainstorm potential sub-tasks or to consider challenges you might encounter. For example, you could ask: "Based on the goal of harmonizing BMI data from EHR files, what are the typical sub-tasks involved in data cleaning and summarization?" The responses from the LLM can offer valuable suggestions and help you structure your workflow more effectively.

In essence, this foundational planning phase is crucial for setting the stage for effective LLM utilization. A well-defined plan, coupled with a thorough understanding of the context, will guide your subsequent interactions with the AI assistant and ensure that the generated code and analysis are relevant, accurate, and aligned with your research objectives. Clarity at this stage ensures that both you and the AI are working toward solving the right problem.

## **Project Plan Examples in the Appendix**

To see how a high-level plan can evolve over time, refer to these example project plan files in the [docs/templates/](../docs/templates/) folder:

- **[ProjectPlan_InitialDraft.md](../docs/templates/ProjectPlan_InitialDraft.md)**  
  A simple, bare-bones plan outlining essential tasks like data ingestion, cleaning, and representative record selection.

- **[ProjectPlan_Improved.md](../docs/templates/ProjectPlan_Improved.md)**  
  A more detailed version that covers filtering, validation steps, and additional best practices.

- **[ProjectPlan_Advanced.md](../docs/templates/ProjectPlan_Advanced.md)**  
  A comprehensive plan that integrates demographic data, applies race-specific BMI categorizations, and includes extensive summary reporting.

These examples illustrate how an initial idea can be refined from a broad outline into a structured, domain-specific project plan that supports effective LLM utilization.
